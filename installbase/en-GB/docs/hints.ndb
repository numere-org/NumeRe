# Basics
Plots and graphs may be modified on mulitple way. "help plotoptions" shows a large part of all options, which may be passed to "plot" and similar commands.
Complex or often recurring inputs may be outsourced to scripts or to procedures as a more abstract variant. "help script" and "help procedure" give the necessary information.
NumeRe may be configured with the command "set". "help set" shows a list of all settings; "list -settings" shows the current configuration.
You may use your data rows just like the columns of a table calculation. But keep in mind that you cannot overwrite the contents of "data()".
The command "new CACHE()" generates a new cache with the name CACHE. "remove CACHE()" removes it completely and "delete CACHE()" deletes only its content. 
Functions can be fitted to data rows using the commands "fit" and "fitw". The documentation at "help fit" gives some hints. The results of the final fit will be protocoled to "<savepath>/numerefit.log" and the fitted function will be defined as "Fit(x)" or "Fitw(x)", respectively.
Numerical and string variables will be recognized automatically depending on their assigned value. If this is ambiguous, then the variables will be identified as numericals.
NumeRe can be linked to a text editor and an image viewer. You'll find the information in "help viewer".
Data, which was loaded to NumeRe's memory, is always write-protected, to keep the rare data pure.
Column headings of data sets can be modified with "DATA(#,J1:J2) = HEADJ1, ..., HEADJ2" and read in similar way. See also "help string".
# Documentation
There is an article for all commands in the NumeRe documentation. Simply enter "help COMMAND", to read it.
A list of all functions is displayed after entering of "list -func", a list of all commands after "list -cmd", a list of all constants after "list -const", a list of all variables after "list -var" and a list of all unit conversions after entering of "list -units".
The NumeRe keyword search is a quite powerful tool, if you're searching for a function or a command. "find TERMS" displays a list of all entries, associated to TERMS and sorted by relevance.
"help idx" or "help index" shows a list of all entries in the NumeRe documentation.
Additional information about commands and functions can be found in the NumeRe online reference: <https://sites.google.com/site/numereframework/onlinereferenz/>
Trivia: "NumeRe" stands for "Numerische Rechnungen" (meaning "numerical calculations"). "numere" is as well the vocative singular of the latin "numerus", which refers to number or quantity.
The cache has a automatic backup function: the automatic backup from the last session will be loaded automatically at startup, too. This is also valid for custom generated caches.
All entries to the NumeRe console and all errors will be protocoled in the file "<>/numere.log".
Have you seen the NumeRe documentation as PDF? You'll find it in the subdirectory "docs" in the root path or as link in the start menue.
# Advanced
You can add your custom commands to NumeRe or overwrite (nearly all) predefined commands with your custom behavior. "help plugins" contains the information, to write the necessary plugin.
The command "eval" can fill automatically a column/line with function values. See "help eval" for further information.
Data rows can be Fourier transformed with the command "fft". "help fft" contains the necessary information, to use this command.
Using "datagrid" you can create data grids (2D data sets) out of other data sets or calculate them from function values. See "help datagrid" for further information.
You can install plugins and procedures with the command "install" out of scripts. "help install" gives further hints. Some corresponding scripts should be located in the subdirectory "scripts".
You can prompt for an input during the execution of a script or a procedure, if you use the expression "??". See "help ??" for further information.
"data -paste" starts the pasting mode. After invoking this command, you can enter tabular data form the clipboard. Further information can be found in "help data".
Results of functions and commands, which will return multiple values or strings simultaneously, can either be assigned to data objects or to "temporary columns" ("{x,y,z,...}" or "{str1,str2,str3,...}", respectively).
The command "matop" allows matrix operations (see "help matop" for further information). Determinants, Invertion and special matrices are also possible.
"zeroes" and "extrema" can determine intersections with zero or extrema, respectively. See "help zeroes" and "help extrema" for additional information.
Data sets can be used as an index set for other data sets, if they are passed for the corresponding dimension (line or column).
"taylor" calculates a numerical Taylor expansion of a function and defines it in the function "Taylor(x)". See "help taylor" for further information.
First order ordinary differential equations can be solved with "odesolve". See "help odesolve" for further information.
Errors or troubles during writing of procedures? The NumeRe debugger ("set -mode=debug") shows additional information to help you searching for your error.
The "compose" mode gives the possibility, to gather mulitple subplots in one file and to arrange them to a virtual grid. See "help subplot" or "help compose" for additional information.
# Tweaks
Plot intervals with inverted borders (e.g. "[10:-10]") will be plotted inverted.
The parameter "-set" can be replaced nearly everytime with "--"; if both syntax elements appear in one command expression, the variant "-set" has priority. 
In the NumeRe root path you'll find two syntax highlightings for Notepad++. If you use them for writing scripts and procedures in Notepad++, then functions and commands will be emphasised with colors and different font shapes.
The interval of the color scale can additional be modified with the fourth plotting interval: [x1:x2,y1:y2,z1:z2,c1:c2]
With one of the commands "edit", "view" or "open" you can open the desired folder in Windows Explorer.
Lengthy evaluations can be canceled using the "ESC" key. This is valid for scripts, procedures and plugins, too.
The size of the NumeRe window can be configured with "set -windowsize x=WIDTH y=HEIGHT" according your personal desires.
