Cleaned	Improved "About NumeRe" dialog: this dialog is now using wxTextCtrls for automatic text wrapping.
New	Added a functionality for applying an automatic format of a source file. It will add spaces between operator chars and perform some additional changes for improved readability.
New	Added a "clock()" function for measuring the processor clocks
New	Added a "start here" page for new users, which will be displayed, if no other file is open.
Fixed	The debugger always pointed to the line directly above the relevant line. This was fixed.
Cleaned	The list of predefined functions is now managed by the syntaxelements language file.
Added	Constants are now also listed in the symbol tree.
Added	Multiple constants were added to the set of constants.
Fixed	The "region" option was not available for data sets. This was fixed.
Cleaned	Cleaned a little display error in the console during an animation.
Cleaned	The duplicate code analysis runs now in a secondary thread and doesn't lock the GUI any more.
Fixed	Fixed a rare bug, which occured in scripts in combination with vector vars and a singleton vector var, which was overwritten by a scalar equation
Fixed	Re-enabled the recursive expressions of matrices and scalar values in "matop" command mode.
Fixed	Sometimes missing graphs, if they were created in a very short amount of time, are now available.
Fixed	Removed a glitch in the indentation feature, which occured in combination with tabulator characters.
Fixed	There's no intereference between local and global variables, which have the same name and were passed as arguments, any more.
Fixed	The error color of error messages is now interpreted correctly and will appear on every line of the error message.
New	Added the new command "spline", which will calculate cubic slines on defined data points.
New	Added a generalized interval function "ivl()", which was required for the correct implementation of "spline".
Fixed	Missing multiargument functions are now available in "matop" mode.
Applied	The static code analyzer now finds missing parentheses. It also points now to some error positions and will display a summary of all notes, warnings and errors.
Fixed	Removed an issue with the "size()" function in the matop mode: it returned a size larger than zero, although the matrix had a zero size
Fixed	Removed an issue in the string parser with many "#" opertors
Fixed	Fixed a little bug with whitespaces in argument's parentheses
Added	Procedure flags are now shown in the call tips.
Added	The duplicate code analysis may now semantically replace caches and custom function definitions.
Applied	NumeRe now copies the active settings of the current editor window to a newly created one (loading or new files), if the settings are applicable.
