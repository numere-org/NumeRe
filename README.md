## Scientific data analysis for WindowsÂ® redefined

**NumeRe: Framework for Numerical Computations** is an application for Microsoft WindowsÂ® that can do more than the usual spreadsheets. It provides you with
nonlinear fits of arbitrary functions as well as a ODE solver. It can display 1D and 2D data easily and publication-ready with a simple command. Fourier
transforms are included as well as wavelet transforms. Data is managed in a table-based manner and automatically saved, so you can quickly resume after a
restart.

### Simple tasks are simple

We never understood why you have to write as much code for simple things as for more complex tasks. Our mantra is therefore Keep simple things simple.

### Syntax as intuitive as a language

NumeRe's main goal is to be as intuitive as possible, which implies a syntax that is as simple and clear as possible. NumeRe does not try to be dynamically
typed, but deliberately emphasizes that you understand what is happening as soon as you read the code. In addition, the advanced editor highlights different
data structures in different colors, so the syntax may seem a bit "colorful and choppy" at first. But we can guarantee that you will appreciate it very soon.

### Structure built-in

When writing procedures, the deeply-integrated namespaces help you to keep order right away, because each folder automatically corresponds to a namespace.
This makes it possible to have several procedures with the same name that are still unique. The editor supports you by auto-completion, as well as by
displaying tooltips that show documentation and signatures of functions, commands and procedures.

## Screen shots

Get an impression, how NumeRe looks like and what it's able to do for you. Note that although the UI language is *German* in these image, NumeRe is also available in *English*. There's no need to learn a foreign language. ðŸ˜‰

This is how a typical session might look like:

We have a huge embedded documentation in multiple languages available in every distribution:

### How can you support us?

The question should rather be: how do you want to support us? Do you want to work directly on the code and develop new features? Or do you want to suggest
new features or do you have a suggestion for improvement? Maybe you have found a problem?

### Contact us

**Get in touch with us through the following ways:**
- Oldschool: Write us a mail
- Bug or idea: Submit a ticket
- Chat: Talk or chat with us directly on Discord

**Your skills**

For the development of new features you will need these skills:
- Experience in C++ (C++11 onwards)
- Experience with programming and debugging

**Your tools**

We use these tools and frameworks (we also provide a complete setup as a compiler suite with all libraries):
- MinGW/TDM-GCC
- MathGL
- Gnu Scientific Library (GSL)
- Boost
- wxWidgets
- Code::Blocks
