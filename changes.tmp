Fixed	Symbols created with "declare" may now also be used together with methods.
New	The function "getuserinfo()" will return information about the user name, id and homedir.
Fixed	The support for logical operations on strings was improved.
Fixed	Table cells can now be used for window item values as expected.
New	The command "mail" can be used to send e-mails via SMTP.
Added	The constant "loremipsum" contains the famous text to be used as example text.
Applied	The performance of the new parser model was greatly improved and is now at about 70-80% of the previous approach for scalar operations.
Added	A duration type is now available to increase the date-time logic.
Added	Functions for base-n encoding "encode_base_n()" and decoding "decode_base_n()" have been added.
Cleaned	Histograms can now only be calculated from 32 columns or less or for a whole grid at once using the "asgrid" option.
Fixed	The editor TAB setting is now applied completely and correctly to all editor instances.
Added	Inserted a possible fix for the inresponsive MySQL server.
Fixed	Corrected problematic situations, where function might have x^0 in their formal definitions, which should be evaluted to 1 even if x == 0.
Cleaned	The autocompletion now returns string-parsed vars as their original type.
Fixed	Table methods were not handled correctly, if they are combined with "print". This was resolved.
Added	It is now possible to suppress the success messages of "load" using the option "mask" to reduce the noise within scripts.
Applied	String functions, which convert one input into an array, do now return arrays of clusters (one for each input element). Notable candidates: "textparse()", "to_value()", "split()" and all character classifier functions like "is_alnum()".
Cleaned	Method resolution is now more precise. This is a preparing step for supporting structures and classes.
New	Experimental: "dictstruct" is now available as a dictionary/dynamic structure hybrid.
Added	Experimental: "obj" can be used to declare procedure-local objects and structures
Added	Experimental: "readxml()" and "readjson()" can be used to load the corresponding file types to DictStruct instances.
Added	Experimental: the index operator "[]" can now be used on usual vectors as well as the dimension variable "nlen".
Added	Experimental: the "file" object can be used for arbitrary file reads and writes.
Added	Experimental: the "stack" object provides standard stack functionalities.
Added	Experimental: the "queue" object provides standard queue (deque) functionalities.
Added	Experimental: the "path" object provides a common interface to generic paths (files, folders, namespaces) and can be used mostly everywhere, where plain filepaths are required as well as for addressing data in dictstruct instances.
Cleaned	"getfileparts()" will now return the host as drive for UNC paths.
Fixed	Vectorial variables are now supported in "matop", but not fully compatible to inline created vectors using the brace syntax "{x,y,z,...}", because they will not be auto-expanded to matrices if necessary. To resolve this, either wrap the vectorial variable into additional braces or enclose it into an explicit "repmat()" call. This is a known issue and will be resolved in a future version together with the complete rework of "matop".
Fixed	Installation of package dependencies from the repository directly using only the command line interface now works as expected.
Applied	It is now possible to use SQL placeholders in SQL statements. The corresponding values can be supplied with the "params=[PARAMLIST]" option.
