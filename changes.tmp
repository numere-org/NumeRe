Fixed	Resolved a problem with inverted user names (NAME, GIVENNAME) in "getuserinfo()".
Added	Using the "-tex" option on the "help" command will only yield documentation articles from the "standard" set and no autogenerated ones.
New	The function "swapbytes" can be used to convert from little to big endian byte order and vice versa.
Cleaned	Files in package project are now stored relative to their corresponding root folder. You have to save the package project again to apply this behavior.
Applied	Time axes may now get a custom stepping and the legend positions have some more possibilities.
Added	You can now view tabular data directly from the file try by right-clicking on it and selecting the corresponding option.
Added	The revision dialog now shows a built-in editor, where Diffs may be examined.
Cleaned	The flickering in the terminal during making a selection has been reduced.
Removed	"getfolderlist()" does not return relative file paths any more.
Fixed	"jsonencode" and "jsondecode()" will now encode and decode date-time values correctly.
Fixed	Erronous errors about missing parentheses and a warning about misuse of "nlen" if it was used within square vector brackets have been removed.
Cleaned	Line numbers in PDF documentations are now continued correctly.
Added	"imrot" and co now feature the options "size={X,Y}" and "keepdim" (for keeping the original dimensions).
Fixed	Storing dictstruct fields in a table is now possible.
Cleaned	If the last row of a table is edited in the table editor via the category value combobox, a new row is now added automatically.
Fixed	Multiplication with different vector lengths works now in a reliable manner.
Added	Functions for verifying results within a SW testing scenario have been added: verifyval(), verifyneq(), verifyrange()
Fixed	Combined dictstruct assignments are now possible.
Fixed	An internal error during plotting occuring if a command inside a "compose" block terminates with a ";" has been resolved.
Added	The method "contains()" was added to dictstructs.
Added	"treelist" GUI elements do now accept dictstructs via the value option during runtime.
Fixed	Function definitionscan now use objects and their methods as expected.
Fixed	Fields of dictstructs are no longer accidentally overwritten if used inside an expression.
Fixed	The debugger will now trigger again at the first breakpoint in the following run of a script, if the previous run of the script was continued with the "Leave" functionality.
New	Procedure inlining using the "inline" procedure flag works now far better and also accepts only partial inlined procedure call trees.
Added	The function "to_html()" can be used to convert values into HTML, supporting also markup language. Note that only a subset of Markdown is supported.
Cleaned	The static code analyzer will now show an error, if too few arguments are used on functions, methods and procedures.
Cleaned	The "matop" functionalities have been close-to-completely moved to the standard expression parsing. There are slight syntactical differences, though. See "help matop" for porting information
Cleaned	Due to the syntactical differences, "matop" will still be supported but is marked as deprecated. A warning will be shown, if the command is still used.
Applied	Round parentheses indexing will create matrices and vectors as output, square brackets will always create plain arrays.
Applied	Tables will accept row and column vectors for rows and columns interchangably for maintaining backwards compatibility.
Fixed	Viewing dictstructs with void fields does not crash the application any more.
Cleaned	Storing void values in dictstructs, queues and stacks is now partly possible, although those values cannot be used.
Cleaned	The error message, if a method is called with void values, has been changed to the "dereferencing void" message for better understandability.
New	Window layouts now feature groups of type "flexgrid" which do allow elements to be placed in cells with their individual spans.
Fixed	Window layouts in activated dialog mode are now forced to be in front of all other windows. Accidental triple-clicks are no longer a problem.
Added	Multiple matrix functions were added: "cat()", "squeeze()", "rotmat()", "levicivita()", "rank()", "gaussjordan()" (with alias "rref()"), "trilow()", "triup()" and "insertscalardim()"
Fixed	The vector methods "VECT.rem" and "VECT.ins" do now also work with the generator syntax.
Applied	The vector methods "VECT.delegate", "VECT.rem" and "VECT.ins" do now support multi-dimensional indexing.
Applied	Properties of multiple GUI elements can now be read and written simultaneously.
Added	The methods "DICT.encodexml" and "DICT.decodexml" do encode the dictstructs contents into an XML string or decode an XML string into this dictstruct.
Applied	The methods "DICT.encodexml" and  "DICT.encodejson" do now have an optional argument to pretty-print the resulting string output.
Cleaned	If you do not enter the correct package identifier during "install", possible candidates are now listed and you can select from those.
Applied	Vectorial variables and expressions can now be plotted just like regular expressions.
Applied	Some commands do now accept matrices as their inputs in addition to tables: "diff", "eval", "datagrid", "fft", "fft2d", "fwt", "audio", "detect", "extrema", "zeroes", "fit" and "database". Note that this does not automatically include the algorithmic extension to multiple dimensions.
Cleaned	If there are multiple candidates for possible documentation articles, a clickable list shows them now.
Cleaned	Files are now expected to be in UTF8 and saved in this encoding.
Applied	NumeRe supports now UTF8 encoding in code, which means, you can now use any reasonable unicode character. Code identifiers are still limited to the standard ASCII alphabet.
Cleaned	The terminal now supports non-ASCII characters as well. Additionally, the selection appearance was unified with the editor appearance (only grey background).
Added	Plots can now support CJK ideographs, if either "noto" or "notosf" is used as plot font. Loading this font can take some seconds due to its file size, so please be patient.
Added	"stix" and "stix2" has been added as plotting font.
Cleaned	String functions do now interact on bytes, which are only identical to characters in the ASCII-only case. Notable exception is the usage of characters a function inputs (e.g. "strmatch()"). Those will be handled as characters instead.
Added	Methods for handling characters and unicode have been added to the string object: "STR.chr()", "STR.unicodelen", "STR.normalize()", "STR.collate()".
Applied	The function "char()" has been renamed to "byte()", because that provides a better indication of its functionality. The old name is still interpreted as alias, but shall not be used anymore.
Added	Byte sequences, which do not represent a valud UTF8 encoding, are now represented as HEX encoded value: "\xHH", where "HH" indiciates two hex digits. You can now also use this syntax to add arbitrary byte values into a string, e.g. "\xC3\xA7" will produce a "ç" character.
Fixed	Made the leaf concatenation of object.path with a (literal) string value actually possible.
