Fixed	Resolved a problem with inverted user names (NAME, GIVENNAME) in "getuserinfo()".
Added	Using the "-tex" option on the "help" command will only yield documentation articles from the "standard" set and no autogenerated ones.
New	The function "swapbytes" can be used to convert from little to big endian byte order and vice versa.
Cleaned	Files in package project are now stored relative to their corresponding root folder. You have to save the package project again to apply this behavior.
