Added	It is now possible to pass plotting options to "hist" and "hist2d" directly. Due to name conflicts, we had to rename the previously "grid" option to "asgrid".
New	The new flow control command "leave" allows jumping out of nested loops completely without the need of unnecessary complex "if-else" checks and boolean flags.
Cleaned	The editor and the terminal will now only provide method autocompletion with methods fitting to the variable type.
Added	It's now possible  to define the file type of the loaded or saved file if that is different from the standard file extension.
