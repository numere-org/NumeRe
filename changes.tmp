Cleaned	Some file types do no longer require automatic conversion upon file load.
Cleaned	If the debugger is in control and the user tries to close the application, a confirmation dialog appears.
Added	The font size within "text()" can now adapted in 9 distinct steps.
Added	Strings in tables shown in the table viewer can now be shown without the surrounding quotation marks, if the corresponding setting value is changed. This does not apply for clusters.
Added	It's now also possible to copy only a part of a table to another table at a desired location using "TAB(i1:i2,j1:j2) = TAB2(i1:i2,j1:j1)" syntax.
Applied	Plots of large data sets have been sped up by downsampling the used data to result image size before plotting it.
Cleaned	Indentation of wrapped lines in created documentation now works as expected (not falling back to the beginning of the line any longer).
Fixed	Resolved a rarely occuring off-by-one error within the possibility to start a script from a specific line.
Applied	Improved some internals to speed up some calculations.
Added	New string function "strjoin()" will allow for concatenation of a vector of strings into a single string with an optional separator.
Applied	The function context tooltip will now align with the opening brace whereever possible.
Added	More shortcuts have been added to the table viewer, especially the arrow-shift and arrow-ctrl key kombinations.
New	The new table method modifier ".cells()" together with ".rows" or ".cols" allows for selection of table cells along the direction of application.
Cleaned	If the line length indicator is active, then lines longer than twice the indicated length will be wrapped completely, i.e., wrapped multiple times.
Fixed	If comment lines are wrapped automatically, orphan whitespaces at the beginning of the wrapped line resulting from leading punctuation characters are now removed (corresponding to known word wrapping behaviors).
Fixed	If comment lines are wrapped automatically, they are not longer wrapped right after opening braces.
Added	Documentation block comments now also support enumerations.
Added	A new Table method to perform kmeans clustering on specified columns of numberical data. kmeansof({columns}, #clusters, maxIterations = 100, init-method="random", re-initializations=10)
