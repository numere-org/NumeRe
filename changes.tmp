Added	Function uuid(), returning a uuid as string
Cleaned	Some file types do no longer require automatic conversion upon file load.
Cleaned	If the debugger is in control and the user tries to close the application, a confirmation dialog appears.
Added	The font size within "text()" can now adapted in 9 distinct steps.
Added	Strings in tables shown in the table viewer can now be shown without the surrounding quotation marks, if the corresponding setting value is changed. This does not apply for clusters.
Added	It's now also possible to copy only a part of a table to another table at a desired location using "TAB(i1:i2,j1:j2) = TAB2(i1:i2,j1:j1)" syntax.
Applied	Plots of large data sets have been sped up by downsampling the used data to result image size before plotting it.
Cleaned	Indentation of wrapped lines in created documentation now works as expected (not falling back to the beginning of the line any longer).
Fixed	Resolved a rarely occuring off-by-one error within the possibility to start a script from a specific line.
Applied	Improved some internals to speed up some calculations.
Added	New string function "strjoin()" will allow for concatenation of a vector of strings into a single string with an optional separator.
Applied	The function context tooltip will now align with the opening brace whereever possible.
Added	More shortcuts have been added to the table viewer, especially the arrow-shift and arrow-ctrl key kombinations.
New	The new table method modifier ".cells()" together with ".rows" or ".cols" allows for selection of table cells along the direction of application.
Cleaned	If the line length indicator is active, then lines longer than twice the indicated length will be wrapped completely, i.e., wrapped multiple times.
Fixed	If comment lines are wrapped automatically, orphan whitespaces at the beginning of the wrapped line resulting from leading punctuation characters are now removed (corresponding to known word wrapping behaviors).
Fixed	If comment lines are wrapped automatically, they are not longer wrapped right after opening braces.
Added	Documentation block comments now also support enumerations.
Added	A new Table method to perform kmeans clustering on specified columns of numberical data. kmeansof({columns}, #clusters, maxIterations = 100, init-method="random", re-initializations=10)
Fixed	Procedures with relative namespaces can also be used within control flow blocks.
New	Table columns can now have (physical) units to represent data even better. The units will be detected automatically (if possible), or you can use the dedicated methods to modify the unit of each column.
New	The table method "TAB().toSIunits()" can be used for symbolic unit calculations.
Applied	The kernel was greatly rewritten and supports much more different types and functionalities. Strange typing problems shouldn't appear any more. Overall performance should be improved (although at the cost that some segments might run slower).
New	Multiple functions and constants for dealing with time have been added.
Applied	Data plots with time vals in one of their dimensions will now auto-activate the corresponding time axes.
Added	The static code analyzer will now warn, if the table and cluster types are used without their parentheses.
Fixed	TAB().categorize(...) is now working as intended.
Added	"remove" can now also remove whole folders recursively.
Fixed	Tables can now be loaded completely using the "keepdim" option. Omitting this option will still strip away empty columns.
Added	Local variables may now also be declared within control flow blocks. Note that they are only declared for the first time per execution the control reaches their command.
Added	Tables may now be exported in MarkDown and HTML format.
Applied	"alphamask" and "colormask" may now be used together with "marks" in "plot3d"
Added	A search bar was added to the history to search for previous commands.
Fixed	Setting a selection within "tablegrid" does not fire an "onclick" event any more.
Added	Functions were added: "is_equal()", "is_ordered()", "is_unique()" and "inv_pct()"
Fixed	The command "sort" has been improved and surprising behaviors have been removed.
Added	Table method modifiers ".scwin()" and ".srwin()" have been added and can be used to define a moving window for multi argument functions.
New	Additional coherent noise functions were added: "ridgedmulti()", "billownoise()", "voronoinoise()"
Added	A categorical conditional cell colouring scheme was added to the table viewer.
Applied	Table method handling has been improved and chaining with the new internal method system is now possible.
