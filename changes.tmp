Cleaned	NDAT files do no longer show "NOTHING", if the extended file information setting has been turned off.
Fixed	edit can now handle paths supplied via string variables again.
Fixed	The "start from line" functionality of scripts now doesn't create endless loops, if the starting line lays beyond the valid regime.
Fixed	Layout scripts are now better checked against syntax and typing errors (notably unmatched parentheses).
Cleaned	The function "cnt()" will now return 0 if "void" values are inserted as its argument (note that this is not true for an array of "void" values. Empty columns and empty tables will now also return "void" instead of "nan".
Added	The functions "complement()", "intersection()" and "union()" provide means to apply set theory operations.
Added	A menu option is now available to check for NumeRe updates.
Added	You can now change the file filters for each of the default folders in the left tree. The option can be found beneath the path settings in the settings dialog.
Applied	Detection of readable and loadable files has been improved, so that you can now also read files without known extension.
Applied	The "required version" of packages now uses the correct variant of the current version for checking, e.g. "v.1.1.7.2412".
Cleaned	Window layouts are now also part of the dependency analysis and will correctly return their event procedures.
New	The command "install" will now automatically search through the package repository for a package with matching filename.
Added	The table viewer can now sort and filter the displayed table according a selected column.
Fixed	Undoing pastes of long strings into the terminal with ESC are not resulting in an endless loop anymore.
Added	It is now possible to set a custom HTTP header and a payload if you want to interact with REST APIs using "url".
Updated	The starting page was greatly reworked and provides more options.
Fixed	The initializing of fitting parameters is now set to zero and not to "void" any more.
Cleaned	The interface for "odesolve" and "fit" have been adapted to follow the current syntax approach more.
Fixed	The correct column title is now used as plotting legend, if used in scenarios like "plot TABLE()"
Fixed	The automatic date-time conversion of columns and "to_time()" is now more restrictive and focuses on the valid combinations according DIN5008 and ISO8601 (not all are implemented). Invalid combinations should not be converted any more.
Applied	The method autocompletion recommendation has been improved and should now return better fitting candidates.
Cleaned	Improved and cleaned the "stats" command: some field were renamed or replaced with more important values.
Applied	Most table methods accept now table column names in addition to column IDs. Note: If there are multiple columns with the same name, in general, all will be used for the table method.
Fixed	Resolved a regression with the autocompletion of table methods.
Added	The new table method "replacevals()" can be used to replace every occurence of a set of values with new values.
Fixed	The table method "TAB().anovaof()" is now more robust against invalid values.
Cleaned	The table method "TAB().anovaof()" will now return the results of multi-dimensional ANOVAs in distinct embedded clusters.
Removed	Large tables won't calculate the complete stats anymore, if opened in the table viewer (this is for performance reasons).
Cleaned	The autocompletion in the terminal is much faster now.
Cleaned	The return value of the table method "TAB().indexof()" has been changed to a cluster, where consecutive index sets are stored as embedded clusters.
Added	The option "nobars" can be used together with "hist" to switch the output graph to a dashed line plot with distinct marks at the bars' positions. This can be handy if you try to compare multiple histograms in a single diagram.
Cleaned	The table methods "TAB().categoriesof()" and "TAB().categorize()" will now return an array of categories (see function "category()" for reference) instead of a key-value list. This might break some code.
Added	The character "|" is now also considered a potential column separator for CSV files.
Cleaned	The function "student_t" will no longer subtract 1 from the passed DOF internally.
Added	The function "getoverlap()" returns the overlap of all to be passed intervals.
